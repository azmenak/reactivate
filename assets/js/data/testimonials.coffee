      Emile, I just wanted to congratulate you on the amazing flooring your
      company installed at the home at 1050 Mohawk Drive.  As you know we have
      listed the home for sale, and I can tell you that, without exception, the
      main thing potential buyers key in when visiting the home, is the floor!
      While the whole house is finished at a very high level of quality, it’s
      the wide plank oak floors that get all of the compliments.  Your flooring
      has elevated the value of the home, and created a really solid feel. I’ll
      definitely be calling you when I’m ready to replace the floors in my own
      home.
